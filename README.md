# Vagrant environment for a Windows Server based Active Directory

The idea of this repository is to have an easy way to test LDAP authentication against an Active Directory without the hassle of running a Windows Server, installing, configuring and populate an AD server.

To do this it provides a Vagrant file that lets you spin up a preconfigured virtual machine that has everything you need for testing.

**Note:** this image is currently a work in progress and may change over time. This means tests against the image may break in the future because the data in the provided AD changes. But I expect it to settle eventually.

## Usage

This vagrant box provides you with a preconfigured AD-Server filled with **users** to test against. Have a look at `scripts/users.csv` to see what's available.

To get started, install `vagrant` and `virtualbox` and clone this repository. In the repo run the following to **start the server**:

    vagrant up

**Login to Windows** in using rdesktop with username `EXAMPLE\vagrant` password `vagrant`:

    rdesktop -d EXAMPLE -u vagrant -p vagrant localhost:33389

The machine will map the **LDAP** Ports to `7389` (ldap) and `7636` (ldaps) on the `localhost`. Here's the data you may need to connect:

    base_dn:        DC=example,DC=local
    domain:         example.local
    netbios domain: EXAMPLE
    user:           vagrant@example.local
    password:       vagrant

For **SSL and TLS** a self-signed certificate is generated when the machine starts for the first time. The certificate is also put into the repository's root folder name `cert.der`. You may need to disable certificate verification of your client, or import the certificate to you trusted storage. If needed, you can convert the certificate to PEM format using openssl:

    openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -out cert.pem

**Shutdown** the machine with:

    vagrant halt

The box is based on the official Windows Server 2019 Trial images by Microsoft. The installation is **valid for 180 days**. You can simply destroy the machine and set it up again for another trial period.

    vagrant destroy
